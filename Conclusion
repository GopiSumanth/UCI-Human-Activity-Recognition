1. In ML models on featurized data,  Logistic regression or Linear SVC or rbf SVM outperformed tree based models like Decision trees, random forest and GBDT.

2. Using ML models the highest accuracy obtained was 96.61%

3. In DL we used simple LSTM with 2 layers containg 32 and 6 cells in first and second layer resp. 

4. We obtained 90%+ accuracy on raw data which can be improved with change in architecture by hyperparam tuning.
